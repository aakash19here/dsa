<h1>Recap</h1>
<li>To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
<li>Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
<li>Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
<li>The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
<li>Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice!
