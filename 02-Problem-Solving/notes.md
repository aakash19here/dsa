<h2>Frequency Counter</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem">
This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
<br><br>
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings
</p>
<h2>Multiple Pointers</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem">
Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem">
Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
</p>
<h2>Sliding Window</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem">
This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem">
Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem">
    Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
